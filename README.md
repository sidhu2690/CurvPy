# CurvPy

CurvPy is a powerful data analysis tool that allows you to fit curves to your data in CSV format. It consists of three main functionalities:

## DataSleuth: Guess the Function

In this module, you can input your data, and CurvPy will analyze it to provide a best-guess estimate of the underlying mathematical function that describes your data.

## FuncPlot: Test the Function

Once you have a guess about the function, you can input the mathematical expression, and FuncPlot will generate a graph for you to visually inspect the fit between the function and your data.

## OptiFit: Optimize Parameters

Harness the Power of Optimal Parameters - Effortlessly optimize equation parameters to unlock precise and efficient data modeling.

## Installation 

To use CurvPy, you need to have Python and the following dependencies installed:
- pip
- Flask
- pandas
- NumPy
- matplotlib
- scipy
- scikit-learn

You can install the required dependencies using pip:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- Otherwise, you can individually install all these packages.
- For Linux-based systems, you may need to use pip3 instead of pip.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/your-username/CurvPy.git
```
Note for Windows Users: If you are using a Windows machine, download the project as a ZIP file from the GitHub repository. Extract the ZIP file to a location of your choice and open the command prompt or PowerShell. Navigate to the extracted directory using the cd command and list the files using the dir command. Here's an example:
```shell
cd C:\path\to\CurvPy
dir
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```shell
cd CurvPy
```
3. Install the required dependencies:
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
For Linux-based systems, use pip3 instead of pip.

4. Launch CurvPy:
```shell
python app.py
```
5.Open your web browser and paste the following URL:
```shell
http://localhost:5000
```
6.Start using CurvPy by selecting one of the three main functionalities: DataSleuth, FuncPlot, or OptiFit.
