# CurvPy

CurvPy is a powerful data analysis tool that allows you to fit curves to your data in CSV format. It consists of three main functionalities:

## DataSleuth: Guess the Function

In this module, you can input your data, and CurvPy will analyze it to provide a best-guess estimate of the underlying mathematical function that describes your data.

## FuncPlot: Test the Function

Once you have a guess about the function, you can input the mathematical expression, and FuncPlot will generate a graph for you to visually inspect the fit between the function and your data.

## OptiFit: Optimize Parameters

Harness the Power of Optimal Parameters - Effortlessly optimize equation parameters to unlock precise and efficient data modeling.

## Installation

To use CurvPy, you need to have Python and the following dependencies installed:
- pip
- Flask
- pandas
- NumPy
- matplotlib
- scipy
- scikit-learn

#For Linux users
You can install the required dependencies using pip:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- For Linux-based systems, you may need to use pip3 instead of pip.
